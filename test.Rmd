### **Tentative Project Title**

### **Motivation**
In recent years, the impacts of climate variability and extreme weather events have become increasingly evident across New York State. Understanding local climatic patterns is essential not only for environmental monitoring, but also for informing public health preparedness, agricultural planning, and infrastructure resilience. Despite the availability of rich meteorological datasets, there remains a need for integrated analytical approaches that combine visualization, statistical modeling, and predictive analysis to uncover underlying patterns and trends in regional climate behavior.

This project aims to leverage five years of comprehensive weather data from New York State to visualize and model key climatic variables such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed. Through interactive spatial visualizations—such as precipitation heatmaps across counties—and regression-based analyses, we will identify the major meteorological and geographic factors that shape local weather dynamics. Furthermore, by applying time-series forecasting models, we aim to predict future climatic trends and provide data-driven insights that could support regional planning and climate adaptation strategies.

Ultimately, this project seeks to demonstrate the power of data analytics in translating complex weather information into actionable knowledge, while showcasing technical proficiency in data cleaning, visualization, regression modeling, and time-series forecasting.

### **Variable Introduction**

### **Intended Final Products**

### **Anticipated Data Sources**

### **Planned Analyses/ Visualizations**
Exploratory Data Analysis.
Describe spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, precipitation, and wind speed using histograms, density plots, seasonal subseries, calendar heatmaps, and county-level choropleths. Quantify autocorrelation and inter-variable dependence via correlation heatmaps and lagged correlations. 

Spatiotemporal Association Modeling.  
Fit interpretable regression families (linear/GLM, mixed-effects) to quantify associations between meteorological outcomes and geographic climatic drivers, with county-level random effects where appropriate. Use two-part models for precipitation. Report coefficient forest plots, marginal effects, residual diagnostics, and space–time cross-validation errors.

Forecasting & Predictive Evaluation.
Build short-horizon forecasts with rolling-origin evaluation. For extreme events, train parsimonious classifiers. Evaluate with RMSE/MAE.

Visualization Deliverables.
Standardized map suite like levels and anomalies, seasonal and calendar plots, correlation and diagnostics, coefficient and marginal-effect displays, forecast fan charts and rolling-error summaries.

### **Coding Challenges**

### **Planned Timeline**
Phase I — Introduction & Framing (Early November)
Goal: Establish the analytic scope and motivation for a five‑year, New York State–focused climate analysis.  
Deliverables: Background paragraphs, research questions, simple analysis flow schematic.  

Phase II — Data Cleaning & Harmonization (Early to Mid‑November)
Goal: Acquire and standardize public meteorological data; produce a single analysis‑ready table keyed to geographic identifiers.
Deliverables: Cleaned dataset, data‑quality summary (coverage/missingness), brief data dictionary.  

Phase III — Exploratory Analysis & Visualization (Mid to Late November)
Goal: Describe spatial and temporal patterns in temperature, precipitation, and wind speed to inform modeling.  
Deliverables: EDA portfolio (maps, heatmaps, seasonal plots) with short captions.

Phase IV — Statistical & Predictive Modeling (Late November to Early December)
Goal: Fit an interpretable regression for associations and a short‑horizon forecaster with uncertainty quantification.  
Deliverables: Model summary with diagnostics, forecast error or coverage summary, brief limitations note.  

Phase V — Results, Discussion & Integration (Early to Mid‑December)
Goal: Synthesize evidence into a coherent narrative with implications for monitoring and resilience.  
Deliverables: Finalized figures, completed Results & Discussion, compiled PDF + GitHub document.
